# Cursor Rules for AutoBudget

## Database Access
- You have permission to access the database directly for testing purposes
- You can add, modify, or delete data in the database as needed for development and testing
- Database connection details:
  - Host: localhost
  - Port: 5432
  - Database: autobudget
  - Username: joshkatzenbach
  - No password required (peer authentication)

## RxJS Usage
- RxJS is okay to use, but keep it simple
- Avoid using very complicated RxJS operators
- When it's simpler, convert observables to promises using `.toPromise()` or `.firstValueFrom()` / `lastValueFrom()`
- Prefer straightforward patterns over complex reactive chains
